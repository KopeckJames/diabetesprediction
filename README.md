# Diabetes Health Dataset

## About the Dataset
The **Diabetes Health Dataset** is a collection of health and lifestyle information from patients. The data includes variables such as age, gender, smoking and drinking habits, exercise levels, and diabetes diagnosis. The goal of this dataset is to help understand and predict diabetes by identifying patterns in people's health and daily habits.

## Where the Data Came From
This dataset was compiled from health records of patients being monitored for diabetes. The data has been cleaned and anonymized, meaning no personal identifiers like names or addresses are included. The dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by **Rabie El Kharoua** to support the study of diabetes.

## What's in the Dataset
The dataset contains **46 columns** (features) and thousands of rows, with each row representing one patient. Below are the main categories of information included:

### 1. Personal Information:
- **Patient ID**: A unique identifier for each person.
- **Age**: The patient’s age.
- **Gender**: 0 for male, 1 for female.
- **Ethnicity**: The patient's ethnic group.
- **Socioeconomic Status**: The financial stability of the patient.
- **Education Level**: The highest level of education the patient has completed.

### 2. Health Habits:
- **BMI**: The patient’s Body Mass Index, indicating underweight, normal weight, or overweight.
- **Smoking**: 1 if the patient smokes, 0 if they do not.
- **Alcohol Consumption**: How much alcohol the patient consumes.
- **Physical Activity**: The level of exercise the patient engages in.

### 3. Medical History:
- **Tingling Hands/Feet**: 1 if the patient experiences tingling sensations, 0 if they do not.
- **Exposure to Chemicals/Metals**: 1 if the patient has been exposed to harmful substances, 0 if they have not.
- **Water Quality**: The quality of the water consumed by the patient.
- **Medical Checkups**: The frequency of the patient’s doctor visits.

### 4. Diabetes Information:
- **Diagnosis**: 1 if the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes, 0 if not.
- **Medication Adherence**: How consistently the patient follows prescribed medications.
- **Health Literacy**: How well the patient understands their health and medical care.

## How the Data Can Be Used
This dataset can be used for several purposes:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to predict whether someone has diabetes based on their health habits and medical history.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Understand how well patients follow medical advice and adhere to medication routines.
- **Visual Analysis**: Create charts and reports to show trends in diabetes risk factors, such as how age or physical activity impacts the likelihood of developing diabetes.

## Why This Dataset is Important
The **Diabetes Health Dataset** is a valuable resource for researchers and students looking to learn more about diabetes. It can help:
- Identify the most important factors in preventing or managing diabetes.
- Develop better healthcare programs tailored to patients with diabetes or those at risk.







# Project Requirements

## Data Model Implementation (25 points)
* **Data Extraction, Cleaning, and Transformation**:  
   There is a Jupyter notebook that thoroughly describes the process of data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. The cleaned data is exported as CSV files for the machine learning model.  
   **(10 points)**

* **Model Initialization and Training**:  
   A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model, or alternatively, loads a pretrained model.  
   **(10 points)**

* **Model Accuracy**:  
   The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power with at least 75% classification accuracy or an R-squared value of 0.80.  
   **(5 points)**

## Data Model Optimization (25 points)
* **Documentation of Model Optimization**:  
   The optimization and evaluation process is documented, showing the iterative changes made to the model and the resulting impact on performance. This documentation is presented either in a CSV/Excel table or directly in the Python script.  
   **(15 points)**
